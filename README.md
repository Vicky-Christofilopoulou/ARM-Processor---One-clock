# ARM-Processor---One-clock

The goal of this project is to design the microarchitecture of a simplified single-cycle ARM processor in FPGA technology, using the Vivado IDE (Integrated Development Environment) tool from Xilinx.

The processor consists of two parts: the datapath, which processes data in the appropriate arithmetic and logic units, and the control unit, which decodes the instruction and generates the corresponding control signals.
